        >Programming Is Love :
      </span>
      Everyone has something he or she is passionate about and loves to do every
      time without getting bored, for me it is programming. My first encounter
      with programming was in high school. I started out with visual basic and
      then later on HTML, CSS and C++. I am currently starting out on an online
      arduino course and it has all been a very wonderful experience. Writing
      codes gives me a sense of satisfaction, it is one of the things I feel I
      can do well and enjoy at the same time. Programming requires a lot of time
      and dedication. When I first came across it in high school I never thought
      I could learn it but I started anyway. Hardwork and diligence were my
      watchword as I began my "hello world" journey. I upheld this values like
      my life depended on it not only in learning programming but also in my
      studies. My hardwork and diligence paid off as I saw considerable progress
      and improvements compared to when I started out. Seeing progress after
      watching tons of YouTube videos gave me joy and fueled my passion for
      programming. Success motivates me; when I record more successes than
      failures in trying out a particular thing it increases my love and passion
      for it. This explains my love and passion for coding. However failure
      fuels my desire to be successful, it offers a unique opportunity to learn
      from mistakes and develop strength.
